# Creature keeper

This project is a client-server application developed using a Java-based object-oriented approach. The main objective is to provide a robust and user-friendly system for managing creature records. The application consists of a REST API server implemented with the Spring framework and a JavaFX GUI client.

The REST API server serves as the backend for the application, responsible for storing and managing records of various creatures. It provides endpoints for retrieving, adding, deleting, and modifying creature data. The server utilizes the Spring framework to handle HTTP requests.

On the client side, the JavaFX GUI client offers an intuitive and visually appealing interface for users to interact with the application. It allows users to view all creatures, add new creatures, delete existing ones, and update creature information. The client communicates with the REST API server through RESTful API calls.

Throughout the development process, a strong emphasis was placed on code reusability and maintainability. Reusable components were developed, and component libraries were leveraged to ensure consistency in the user interface and facilitate future enhancements. The object-oriented approach facilitated modular design and encapsulation, leading to cleaner code structure and improved maintainability.


## Technologies

- **Java**: Developed the application using the Java.
- **Spring Framework**: Implemented the REST API server using the Spring framework for CRUD operations
- **JavaFX**: Developed a graphical user interface (GUI) client using JavaFX, allowing users to interact with the application.
- **RESTful API**: Designed and implemented a RESTful API to enable communication between the client and server.
- **Object-Oriented Approach** and **MVC Pattern**: Utilized object-oriented principles and followed the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to design and structure the codebase.
